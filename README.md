QtCookiesSyn
C++ library based on QT5

Purpose
This library is about to solve the following problems:
1.The javascript class `XMLHttpRequest` in QML can't accept any cookies(QML doesn't support DOM, object `document.cookie` doesn't exist).
2.Cookies should be stored in local.
3.In the hyber apps, in order to keep log states, the session cookies, which contains the authorization info, should be unified between QML and H5.
4.From Qt5.6, webEngine(chromium) was import to substitute webkit module, which uses `profile` class to process cookies. To synchronize cookies between QML and webEngine is urgent issue.

Approach & Principle
For QML, replace the default networkAccessManagerFactory in QMLEngine. All networkAccessManagers created by the networkAccessManagerFactory contains a singleton cookieJar(cookie manager). The singleton cookieJar processes all cookies from the networkAccessManagers. Whenever a QML component need HTTP access, it turns to QMLEngine. QMLEngine will call the networkAccessManagerFactory to generate a networkAccessManager for service. Then, after got reply, cookies will be sent to the cookieJar by the manager.

For WebEngine, it use WebEngineCookieStore to store cookies. CookieJar can automatically synchronize cookies with WebEngineCookieStore.

Roles
1.Class `QMLNetworkAccessManagerFactory`, inherit from `QQmlNetworkAccessManagerFactory`, is used to substitute the default networkAccessManagerFactory of QMLEngine. Each networkAccessManager generated by this factory contains a cookieJar which is singleton.
2.Class `NetworkCookieJar`, inherit from `QNetworkCookieJar`, is used to handle with cookies. Singleton, fufill cookies's save, load, insert, delete, update functions.

ToDo
1.For android and ios apps, webEngine is not supported! QML webView is a native API, which use native browser. So how can we synchornize cookies with a native browser? Possible apporach is through Javascript in web page through QWebChannel. Export `NetworkCookieJar` to web page, and use body.onload(){} to send back all cookies.
